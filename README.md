Eight properties of numbers (buzz, duck, palindromic, gapful, spy, sunny and square, jumping, happy and sad) examined with a series of conditions.

"Objectives: 
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

Welcome users;
Display the instructions;
Ask for a request;
If a user enters an empty request, print the instructions;
If the user enters zero, terminate the program;
If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
For one number, print the properties of the number;
For two numbers, print the properties of all numbers in the list;
For two numbers and two properties, print the list of numbers that contain the specified properties;
If a property is preceded by a minus, this property should not be present in a number;
If the user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user.
Once the request is processed, continue execution from step 3.
In this stage, property names include even, odd, buzz, duck, palindromic, gapful, spy, sunny, square, jumping, sad, and happy. Mutually exclusive properties are even/odd, duck/spy, sunny/square, sad/happy pairs, as well as direct opposites (property and -property). The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like."
